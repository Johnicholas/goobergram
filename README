I wanted to play with Mark-Jason Dominus's marvelous linogram program
from his book _Higher-Order Perl_:
http://hop.perl.plover.com/linogram/

But as a Perl tyro I'd rather read it in Python. Since I didn't feel
like translating the linogram parser and interpreter, here's an
attempt to provide the core features of constraints, expressions, and
compound objects as Python objects you can use directly.

(The name was picked at random -- since this isn't exactly MJD's
program. Might be better renamed descriptively like py_linogram_core,
supposing it works out.)
