I wanted to play with Mark-Jason Dominus's marvelous linogram program
from his book _Higher-Order Perl_:
http://hop.perl.plover.com/linogram/

But as a Perl tyro I'd rather read it in Python. Since I didn't feel
like translating the linogram parser and interpreter, here's an
attempt to provide the core features of constraints, expressions, and
compound objects as Python objects you can use directly.
